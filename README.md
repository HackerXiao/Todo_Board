# Todo_Board
A board manage multiple todo_lists and iterms.
In phase_1, I created the TodoBoard only manage a single List which contains many Items.
In phase_2, I refactored the code to support the following features:
* marking items as done
* deleting items
* managing multiple lists in a single board

Here is an example of our final product in action:
